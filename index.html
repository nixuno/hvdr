                    I figured just sending something digital would be easier... unless you wanted to try for that stamp at the post office again:
                    <br /><br />
                    <img src="/spoiled.jpg" alt="Stamp" style="width: 100px;">
                    <br /><br />
                    We haven't known each other exceptionally long, but I've been waking up in the mornings happy that I have such a great friend. You make me feel understood, accepted, handsome, and desirable. I love making you laugh and being absolute clowns together. I've had so much fun over the past month. I hope that I make you feel some of these good things too, even if I know you may never tell me directly. üòâ
                    <br /><br />
                    Thank you for listening to me, being there for me, and wanting to defend me. Thank you for opening up about your own past even a little and letting me know where you're at. I take it seriously and respect your boundaries, even if they're forever immovable. I'll sit outside that wall and goof around with you all day, with or without us going any further than we are right now.
                    <br /><br />
                    Anyway, happy Valentine's Day! I'd ask you to be my valentine, but that sounds cheesy as shit, so:
                    <br /><br />
                    Thanks for letting me into your life a bit. I believe you that it's not easy and it means the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è

                    With love,<br />
